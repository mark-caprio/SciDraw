Conversion to .m:

 - Take original notebook.

 - Open subgroups (Ctrl-{).

 - Delete (or comment out) any interactive test code in non-initialization
   cells (e.g., in FigText.nb).

 - Delete all output (Cell > Delete all output).

 - Set all cells as initialization (Ctrl-8).

 - Save as .m file (<package>-CONVERSION.m).

Retained files (in LegacyNotebookSource):

   <package>.nb -- Last notebook version, before above conversion steps.

   <package>.m -- Corresponding autosaved .m file.

   <package>-CONVERSION.m -- Result of "save as" in above procedure (before
   autoindenting and any manual edits).

Cleanup:

 - Remove all cell marker comments:

    + These are of the form:
    
      (* ::Subsection::Initialization:: *)
      (* ::Text::Initialization:: *)
      (* ::Input::Initialization:: *)

    + Can accomplish with sed:

      foreach f ( *.nb )
        sed '/::Initialization::/d' ${f:r}-CONVERSION.m > ../${f:r}.m
      end
      
 - Do autoindent in emacs.

   + Setup in init.el:

     (autoload 'wolfram-mode "wolfram-mode" nil t)
     (setq wolfram-indent 2)
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.m$" . wolfram-mode))

   + For proper autoindent, a linebreak should be introduced between the ":="
   and "Module" at the start of each module.

 - Clean up vertical whitespace.
